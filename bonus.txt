Design Changes (From 'to-do'  to 'food ordering' system):

1. Food ordering system will pre-populate the list of orders with price to client.
2. Once order selected, system will enlist the choice to client with remove option.
3. System will display count of orders and running total price (inclusive of 7.5% tax)
of all selected food items.
